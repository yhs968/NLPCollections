The term Deep Learning was introduced to the machine learning community by Rina Dechter in 1986, and Artificial Neural Networks by Igor Aizenberg and colleagues in 2000, in the context of Boolean threshold neurons. In 2005, Faustino Gomez and Jürgen Schmidhuber published a paper on learning deep POMDPs through neural networks for reinforcement learning. In 2006, a publication by Geoff Hinton, Osindero and Teh showed how a many-layered feedforward neural network could be effectively pre-trained one layer at a time, treating each layer in turn as an unsupervised restricted Boltzmann machine, then fine-tuning it using supervised backpropagation. The paper referred to learning for deep belief nets. A Google Ngram chart shows that the usage of the term has increased since 2000.
